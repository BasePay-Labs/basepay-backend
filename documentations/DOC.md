## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 About Base

Base is an Ethereum-equivalent Layer 2 (L2) blockchain built on OP Stack by Coinbase. Its mission is to bring the next billion users to the blockchain. Base is a foundational participant in the Superchain, powered by Optimism.

### 1.2 Challenge Description

Our project, BasePay, was developed as part of the Base Hackathon with a focus on two core themes:

**1. Bringing Base to the Masses with a Consumer-Focused Product:**

   - Leveraging Base, we have built a user-friendly consumer product that simplifies payments in various social situations.
   - Our platform facilitates subscription payments, event ticketing, and provides on-chain visibility benefits.

**2. Deploying Distributed Identity Ideas to Enhance Blockchain Friendliness:**

   - We have deployed a project that visualizes on-chain summer data, making blockchain more accessible and social.
   - Our project utilizes a paymaster to cover gas fees for specific user bases such as NFT holders or previous on-chain activity participants.
   - We've integrated account abstraction to offer a smoother onboarding and transaction experience.
